LeptonKit log



Version 2.0 0   Drag & drop, loops. Added  file_byte_normal.  Fixed total Betes.
                printed_in_terminal is now off by default.  Now looks for Byte #
                128 (normalized Byte ID.)Performed extensive control experiments
                and other,  looks like everything's ok, but I can't get the same
                detection possibly because Audacity changed something (yes I can
                see all file Bytes using my very own RawVisual program.)
