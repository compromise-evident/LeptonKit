# Building C++ to analyze raw audio files...

If I take a metal tube that's reflective on the inside, fill it with this oil, and point it at the sun, I should get a higher photon count than if pointed away because individual particles spend more time in the oil--more time to catch particles in their phase changes or whatever possesses them to interact.

How does this tie into overkill infosec? In the future, FBI surveillance vans will use fusion-powered listening devices. And fusion can be detected by observing emitted neutrinos. Maybe one day you'll walk around with a lead pipe connected to your phone and get a thermal-like visual of nearby hydrogen power supplies. This is just the beginning. If this fails, I'll keep adjusting sensitivity, and pursue equipment of no laughing matter...

# long-term goals:

* tubular - something tripod-worthy
* directional - point it to the sun at total eclipse
