# Quick background

Neutrinos are absurdly abundant and truly invisible particles passing through everything. Yet every long once in a while, something possesses them to interact with the real world, such as collision with mineral oil where a photon is produced as a result... How is this related to overkill infosec? In the future, FBI surveillance vans will use fusion-powered listening devices. And fusion can be detected by observing emitted neutrinos. Maybe one day you'll walk around with a lead pipe connected to your phone and get a thermal-like visual of nearby hydrogen power supplies.

# Plan to prove detection

If I take a metal tube that's reflective on the inside, fill it with mineral oil, and point it at the sun, I should get a higher photon count than if pointed away because individual neutrinos spend more time in the oil--more time to catch the neutrino in its phase change or whatever possesses it to interact. (I might have to build a sun-follower and autonom-ize audio-record for over a year just get good numbers.)

# What next?

* LeptonKit.cpp to analyze raw audio files.
* Tubular & directional - something tripod-worthy.
* Try different materials - what if cat piss interacts much better?
* Keep adjusting sensitivity and pursue equipment of no laughing matter.
* Fast neutrino generator to send [messages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino#cite_note-Stancil-Adamson-Alania-etal-2012-116) through the Earth.
