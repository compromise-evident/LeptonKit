untitled.raw is a 1-minute recording. LeptonKit.cpp sees it has 4 '#' scattered throughout hence 4 flashes of light.

# Quick background

Neutrinos are absurdly abundant and truly invisible particles passing through everything. Yet every once in a while, something possesses them to interact with the real world, such as collision with mineral oil--producing a photon.

# What next

* It is said that 65 billion neutrinos run through a squared centimeter of Earth's surface, per second. Currently, LeptonKit reads a flash of light roughly once every 10 seconds. So I have to run the experiment in a mine and see if it's mostly cosmic rays.
* Plan to prove detection: if I take a metal tube that's reflective on the inside, fill it with mineral oil, and point it at the sun, I should get a higher photon count than if pointed away because individual neutrinos spend more time in the oil--more time to catch the neutrino in its phase change or whatever possesses it to interact. (I might have to build a sun-follower and autonom-ize audio-record for over a year just to get good numbers.)
* Tubular & directional - something tripod-worthy.
* Try different materials - insert a long test tube for quick access.
* Keep adjusting sensitivity and pursue equipment of no laughing matter.
* Fast neutrino generator for sending [messages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino#cite_note-Stancil-Adamson-Alania-etal-2012-116) through the Earth (un-takedown-able signal assurance.)

# UPDATE

Testing additional control experiments. Something's wrong. And Audacity has changed its recording style, not sure how or how to revert it. For now, disregard this repository.
