# Quick background:

Neutrinos are absurdly abundant and truly invisible particles that pass through everything. Yet every once in a while, something possesses them to interact with the real world, such as collision with mineral oil where a photon is produced as a result... Hence the search for conditions increasing likelihood of interaction.

# Plan to prove interaction:

If I take a metal tube that's reflective on the inside, fill it with mineral oil, and point it at the sun, I should get a higher photon count than if pointed away because individual neutrinos spend more time in the oil--more time to catch the neutrino in its phase change or whatever possesses it to interact. (I might have to build a sun-follower and autonom-ize audio-record for over a year just get good numbers.)

# Relation to overkill infosec:

In the future, FBI surveillance vans will use fusion-powered listening devices. And fusion can be detected by observing emitted neutrinos. Maybe one day you'll walk around with a lead pipe connected to your phone and get a thermal-like visual of nearby hydrogen power supplies. This is just the beginning. If this fails, I'll keep adjusting sensitivity, and pursue equipment of no laughing matter...

# Long-term:

* Tubular & directional - something tripod-worthy.
* Try different materials - what if cat piss interacts 1,000x better?
* Try pointing it to the sun while powering E/M fields at the tubular entrance.

# Now:

Building C++ to analyze raw audio files (RawVisual as a helping hand.)
